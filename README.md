go-locale
==========
> Locale Detection for Go (Depending on OS)

Relatively good locale detection by operating system is worth doing,
though it isn't really standardized.

Features
--------

* Actually trims the UNICODE whitespace (unlike others)
* Idiomatic don't-stutter naming (unlike others)
* Eliminated use of `init()` and unnecessary `map`
* Defaults to `en_US` but `Default` can be changed

TODO
----

* Long form dates tied to more languages
